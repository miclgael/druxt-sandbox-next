## ðŸ’§ Background

I am familiar with Nuxt, but I am not a Drupal developer. My background is with Wordpress, so learning Druxt for me comes with an additional learning curve. This repo is for my own self-directed learning.

My aim is to use this project to inform my approach in my work and where possible help to improve Druxt documentation.

Example components expect the `/jsonapi` endpoint to return content from Drupal's _Umami_ demo site.

## ðŸ“š Notes

### 1. Don't use MAMP/Pro (for now)

Either use the 1-click Gitpod solution, or if you prefer to work locally, install Docker, and ddev and use those.

Remember to:

- Run `mkcert -install`
- Stop and shut-down MAMP
- Stop other containers running on port 80/443
  - Check for any apps running on ports with e.g. `lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN | grep 443`

### 2. `druxt-site` doesn't work with subfolders or obscure ports

So, why not use MAMP Pro?

In my experience installing Drupal and setting a custom hostname, subfolder and port resulted in errors when running `npm run dev` - (either 404 and a crash or a ECONNREFUSED in the `<DruxtDebug />` component on the front-end).

This is not something I could resolve easily by searching, so I asked for help in the `#druxt-site` channel on the official Druxt discord server. [Permalink &rarr;](https://discord.com/channels/753866667590680587/849520152102043649/954666298212757534)

TL;DR - when attempting to [change ports from the defaults](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/config_yaml/#ddevconfigyaml-options) (in `.ddev/config.yaml`) - the `npm run dev` command will fail.

```
router_http_port: "80"
router_https_port: "443"
```
